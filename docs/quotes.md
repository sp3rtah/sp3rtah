rbage wind, smoke from the chimney
The cry of nature, the laughter of Satan
And all because we
Loved to catch the wind and scatter stones.

Earth can with no doubt support the existance of all of us. But some selfish individuals, organizations and civilizations have decided to snatch and steal excessive resources for themselves, leaving all others with way too little. What happens when your 12hr day job doesn't pay enough for you be assured of tomorrow's meal, when someone on this same planet has enough to feed his 7th generation?
